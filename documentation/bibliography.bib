title = {Eliminating thermal violin spikes from LIGO noise},
author = {Santamore, D. H. and Levin, Yuri},
abstractNote = {We have developed a scheme for reducing LIGO suspension thermal noise close to violin-mode resonances. The idea is to monitor directly the thermally induced motion of a small portion of (a 'point' on) each suspension fiber, thereby recording the random forces driving the test-mass motion close to each violin-mode frequency. One can then suppress the thermal noise by optimally subtracting the recorded fiber motions from the measured motion of the test mass, i.e., from the LIGO output. The proposed method is a modification of an analogous but more technically difficult scheme by Braginsky, Levin and Vyatchanin for reducing broad-band suspension thermal noise. The efficiency of our method is limited by the sensitivity of the sensor used to monitor the fiber motion. If the sensor has no intrinsic noise (i.e. has unlimited sensitivity), then our method allows, in principle, a complete removal of violin spikes from the thermal-noise spectrum. We find that in LIGO-II interferometers, in order to suppress violin spikes below the shot-noise level, the intrinsic noise of the sensor must be less than {approx}2 x 10{sup -13} cm/Hz. This sensitivity is two orders of magnitude greater than that of currently available sensors.},

  abstract={Construction of CLIO (cryogenic laser interferometer observatory) with 100 m baseline length has begun in the Kamioka mine. The tunnel for CLIO has been dug and infrastructure work is now in progress. CLIO is the final step to LCGT (large scale cryogenic gravitational wave telescope) and the first practical construction of a cryogenic interferometer in the world. The objective of CLIO is to demonstrate two of three features of LCGT, which are to utilize the quietness and stable environment of the underground site and to adopt cryogenic sapphire mirrors for thermal noise reduction. Also, it is a joint project by gravitational wave and geophysics researchers. CLIO has a locked Fabry–Perot configuration equipped with ring mode cleaners and cryocoolers to cool the sapphire mirrors to 20 K. The noise level of CLIO is designed to trace the thermoelastic noise of sapphire mirrors which varies from 10 −18 m Hz −1/2 at 300 K to 10 −19 m Hz −1/2 at 20 K around 100 Hz. A 7 m single-arm cryogenic test facility has been built at ICRR (Institute for Cosmic Ray Research), while the 20 m room temperature interferometer is in operation at Kamioka. Technical knowledge developed by these prototypes will be leveraged to realize CLIO.}

  abstract={The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second-generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, USA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry–Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid and high frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015.}

  abstract={The goal of the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is to detect and study gravitational waves (GWs) of astrophysical origin. Direct detection of GWs holds the promise of testing general relativity in the strong-field regime, of providing a new probe of exotic objects such as black holes and neutron stars and of uncovering unanticipated new astrophysics. LIGO, a joint Caltech–MIT project supported by the National Science Foundation, operates three multi-kilometer interferometers at two widely separated sites in the United States. These detectors are the result of decades of worldwide technology development, design, construction and commissioning. They are now operating at their design sensitivity, and are sensitive to gravitational wave strains smaller than one part in 10 21 . With this unprecedented sensitivity, the data are being analyzed to detect or place limits on GWs from a variety of potential astrophysical sources.}
